                    Whether as interns or early-career professionals, Stevens business students are trusted with high-profile assignments in areas like disruptive technologies, optimization, strategic marketing, predictive analytics and risk assessment, because corporate
                    managers know these skills are at the core of their education. Stevens students also are excellent presenters and collaborators thanks to assignments that require working in teams to manage timelines, complete projects, and report
                    findings to peers and industry guests. School of Business alumni are highly sought after for their ability to leverage data and apply analytical insights in solving problems. Stevens students learn to think critically about technology
                    as they learn new tools and find creative ways to use them in real business settings. Our alumni go on to exciting careers at Verizon, Goldman Sachs, Apple, EY, Google, Barclays, BD and other Fortune 500 companies, in nearby Manhattan
                    and beyond, where they are able to make smarter decisions faster thanks to an understanding of how to mine, visualize and analyze data with great sophistication and efficiency.
